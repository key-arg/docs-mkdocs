# Sessions

**Sessions** are a key metric in web analytics that represents a group of user interactions with a website within a limited time period. Typically, a session lasts up to 30 minutes without activity, after which a new one begins. This metric helps evaluate how users spend time on a site and analyze their behavior overall.

## Definition

In the context of analytics systems, such as our analytics counter, *sessions* are recorded as a sequence of user actions, including page views, clicks, and other events. A session begins with the first interaction (e.g., page load) and ends after a period of inactivity or when the traffic source changes. This includes:

- Viewing multiple pages within a single visit.
- Interactions with site elements (e.g., form filling).
- Automatic session termination after 30 minutes of inactivity.

It's important to note that sessions are **not** equal to unique visitors: one user can generate multiple sessions per day if they return to the site after a break.

!!! tip "Beginner's Tip"
    If you're just starting with analytics, remember: sessions are a "container" for other metrics. They show the number of "visits" but not the depth of engagement. For deeper analysis, combine them with metrics like *pageviews* or *time on site*.

## Difference from Other Metrics

To better understand sessions, let's compare them with similar terms:

- **Pageviews**: The total number of page loads. One session can include multiple pageviews.
- **Unique visitors**: The number of unique users over a period, regardless of the number of sessions.
- **Bounce rate**: The percentage of sessions with one pageview and no further interactions.

| Metric | What It Measures | Example Usage |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Sessions** | Number of "visits" to the site | Analyzing traffic by day |
| **Pageviews** | Total number of page views | Evaluating content popularity |
| **Unique Visitors** | Unique users | Measuring site audience |

## How Sessions Work in Practice

For a beginning webmaster, it's important to understand how this metric affects site analysis. Imagine you have a news portal. If the number of sessions is growing, this could indicate:

1. Increased traffic from search engines or advertising.
2. Site problems (users leave and return, starting new sessions).
3. Seasonal factors (activity peaks at certain times of day).

To track sessions, install our analytics counter code on every page of your site. Our system automatically groups interactions into sessions based on time and behavior.

!!! info "Example"
    Let's say a user visits your site in the morning, views 3 pages, and leaves. That's 1 session. In the evening, they return after 2 hours and view 2 more pages â€” that's a second session. Result: 2 sessions from one user.

!!! info "Example"
    An online store recorded 500 sessions in a day, of which 300 had only one pageview (high bounce rate). This means 60% of visitors leave immediately, possibly due to irrelevant content or slow loading.

For more accurate analysis, use filters in our analytics to exclude bots or internal traffic. Our tool will allow you to monitor these statistics and understand them, as well as cross-reference with other metrics for deep analysis.
