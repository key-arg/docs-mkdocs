!!! info "About AI participation in writing articles"

    This article, like many others on our site,
    was created, written and proofread by a team of developers.
    Of course, not without the participation of AI assistants. We don't hide
    this and believe that modern systems are already quite
    good at handling simple tasks and,
    relatively speaking, writing an article about Viewport
    yourself is quite strange. It won't come out significantly better and will take
    a lot of time. But providing basic understanding to beginner
    webmasters is necessary.
    Of course, after the article is written by assistants - there's always
    proofreading, and this is where not one or two people participate,
    and only after that the article is published.
