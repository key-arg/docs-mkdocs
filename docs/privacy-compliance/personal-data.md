# Personal Data: Definition, Examples and Global Processing Requirements

Personal data forms the foundation of modern web analytics systems and digital marketing. According to GDPR, personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. Understanding what constitutes personal data is critically important for developing analytics systems that comply with international data protection requirements.

## What is Personal Data

Personal data includes any information concerning an identified or identifiable natural person — a person who can be identified directly or indirectly, particularly using identifiers or factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social characteristics of that person.

### Identification Criteria

**Direct Identification**

- First and last name
- Passport or ID number
- Social security number
- Biometric data

**Indirect Identification**

- IP addresses combined with other information
- Cookie identifiers
- Location data
- Behavioral patterns in web analytics

!!! info "Examples of Personal Data in Web Analytics"

    **Obvious Identifiers:**

    - User email addresses
    - Phone numbers
    - Postal addresses
    
    **Less Obvious but Identifying Data:**

    - User IDs in analytics systems
    - Browser fingerprinting data
    - Activity timestamps combined with other parameters
    - Purchase or conversion data

## Classification of Personal Data

### Ordinary Personal Data

=== "Contact Information"
    
    **Examples:**

    - First name, last name
    - Email addresses
    - Phone numbers
    - Postal addresses
    
    **Processing Features:**
    
    - Requires lawful basis for processing
    - Data minimization principle
    - Purpose limitation

=== "Identification Data"
    
    **Examples:**

    - Document numbers
    - Customer ID
    - Analytics system User ID
    - Device ID
    
    **Processing Features:**
    
    - High degree of identification
    - Requires additional protection measures
    - Data access auditing

=== "Technical Information"
    
    **Examples:**

    - IP addresses
    - Cookie data
    - Browser fingerprints
    - Session ID
    
    **Processing Features:**
    
    - May be personal depending on context
    - Requires analysis of identification possibility
    - Subject to minimization principles

### Special Categories of Personal Data

GDPR identifies special categories of personal data that require enhanced protection: data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, genetic data, biometric data, health data, and data concerning sexual orientation.

!!! warning "Restrictions on Processing Special Categories of Data"
    
    **Processing Principles:**

    - Direct prohibition of processing by default
    - Exceptions only with explicit consent
    - Additional technical protection measures
    - Mandatory Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)

| Data Type | Requirements | Analytics Examples |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Racial/Ethnic Data** | Explicit consent or vital interests | Demographic user segmentation |
| **Political Views** | Explicit consent or public interest | Targeting based on political preferences |
| **Health Data** | Medical purposes or explicit consent | Health & wellness apps, fitness trackers |
| **Biometric Data** | Unique identification | Face ID, voice assistants, fingerprint scanners |

## International Definition Standards

### GDPR (European Union)

GDPR interprets personal data as broadly as possible — any information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. This includes subjective information such as opinions, assessments and judgments.

**Key GDPR Features:**

- Extraterritorial effect
- Accountability principle
- Privacy by design
- High fines (up to 4% of global turnover)

### CCPA/CPRA (California, USA)

CCPA defines personal information as "information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer, device, or household."

**CPRA Extensions:**

- Introduction of "Sensitive Personal Information" (SPI) concept
- Right to limit use of SPI
- Creation of California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA)

### PIPEDA (Canada)

PIPEDA uses a broad definition of personal information — any information that can be used to identify a person, including traditional identifiers and financial or medical information.

**PIPEDA's 10 Fair Information Principles:**

1. **Accountability** — appointing someone responsible for compliance
2. **Identifying Purposes** — clear formulation of collection reasons
3. **Consent** — obtaining permission before data collection
4. **Limiting Collection** — only necessary information
5. **Limiting Use and Disclosure** — strictly for stated purposes
6. **Accuracy** — maintaining data currency
7. **Safeguards** — technical and organizational measures
8. **Openness** — transparency of processing policies
9. **Individual Access** — right to view personal data
10. **Challenging Compliance** — complaint procedures

### LGPD (Brazil)

LGPD defines personal data as any information that helps directly or indirectly identify a person, which is significantly broader than PIPEDA. The law was created following the GDPR model and unifies 40 different sectoral regulations.

## Pseudonymization and Anonymization

### Pseudonymization

Pseudonymization is a technique that replaces or removes information in a dataset that identifies a person, but pseudonymized data remains personal data under GDPR.

!!! tip "Pseudonymization Methods"
    
    **Technical Solutions:**

    - Replacing names with reference numbers
    - Hashing identifiers
    - Data tokenization
    - Encryption with separate key storage
    
    **Advantages:**

    - Reduced risks for data subjects
    - Compliance with minimization principle
    - Simplified analytics processing
    - Preserved re-identification capability when necessary

### Anonymization

Anonymized data does not fall under GDPR if anonymization is irreversible and the data subject is no longer identifiable.

**True Anonymization Criteria:**

- Impossibility of singling out
- Impossibility of linkability
- Impossibility of inference

## Personal Data in Web Analytics Context

### Data Collection in Analytics Systems

Modern web analytics systems collect extensive volumes of information, much of which may qualify as personal data:

**Session-based Data**

- Unique session identifiers
- Activity timestamps
- Page view sequences
- Duration and bounce rate data

**Device Fingerprinting**

- Browser and OS parameters
- Screen resolution and timezone
- Installed fonts and plugins
- Canvas fingerprints

**Behavioral Analytics**

- Heatmaps and click tracking
- Scroll depth and time on page
- Form interaction analytics
- A/B testing data

!!! note "Defining Personal Data in Analytics"
    
    Even if a system doesn't directly collect names or email addresses, the combination of behavioral data, device technical characteristics, and temporal patterns can create a unique profile that allows user identification.
