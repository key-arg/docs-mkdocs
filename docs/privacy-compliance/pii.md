# PII (Personally Identifiable Information): Protecting Personal Data in Web Analytics

**Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** is any information that can be used to identify a specific individual directly or in combination with other data. In the context of web analytics, PII presents special challenges for compliance with data protection legislation, such as GDPR and CCPA, requiring analytics platforms to implement comprehensive protective measures.

## PII Fundamentals

### Definition and Categories

PII includes any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, either alone or in combination with other personal information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual.

=== "Direct Identifiers"

    Data that uniquely identifies a person:

    - Full name
    - Social Security number
    - Passport number
    - Email address
    - Phone number
    - Biometric data

=== "Indirect Identifiers"

    Information that can identify a person when combined:

    - Date of birth
    - ZIP code
    - IP address
    - Cookie ID
    - Demographic characteristics
    - Geolocation data

### PII vs Personal Data

It's important to understand the difference between the American concept of PII and the European definition of personal data:

| Aspect | PII (USA) | Personal Data (GDPR) |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Definition** | Distinguishing a specific person | Any information relating to an identifiable person |
| **Scope** | Focus on identification | Broader concept |
| **IP addresses** | Not always considered PII | Considered personal data |
| **Cookies** | Disputed classification | Definitely personal data |
| **Regulation** | Various federal/state laws | Unified GDPR regulation |

!!! info "Key Difference"
    
    According to Article 29 Working Party opinion, personal data that has been de-identified, encrypted or pseudonymized but can be used to re-identify a person remains personal data and falls within the scope of GDPR.

## PII Sensitivity Classification

### Sensitive PII

Sensitive PII is any information whose disclosure could cause significant harm to an individual:

**Financial Data:**

- Credit card numbers
- Bank account details
- Financial history
- Tax identifiers

**Medical Data:**

- Medical history
- Prescriptions and diagnoses
- Biometric indicators
- Genetic information

**Government Identifiers:**

- Social Security numbers
- Driver's licenses
- Passport data
- Military IDs

### Non-sensitive PII

Data that alone would not cause substantial harm but could be dangerous in combination:

- Name (without additional data)
- Place of work
- Education
- Public social media profiles
- ZIP code

!!! warning "Combination Risk"
    
    It's important to understand that non-PII can become PII when additional information becomes publicly available from any source, which in combination with other available information could be used to identify an individual.

## PII Risks and Threats

### Identity Theft

With just a few pieces of an individual's personal information, thieves can create false accounts in their name, accumulate debt, create a fake passport, or sell their identity to a criminal.

**Consequences for Users:**

## PII in Web Analytics

### Data Collection Issues

In web analytics, many standard metrics may contain PII:

**Automatically Collected PII:**

```javascript
// Potentially problematic data
{
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",        // PII under GDPR
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",       // Indirect identifier
  "session_id": "abc123...",            // Can link activity
  "client_id": "GA1.2.123456...",       // Persistent identifier
  "geolocation": "lat:40.7, lng:-74.0", // Precise geolocation - PII
  "referrer": "https://internal-app.com/user/john" // May contain PII
}
```

**PII in Custom Events:**

- Email in event parameters
- Usernames in URLs
- Personal identifiers in custom dimensions
- Search queries with personal terms

!!! example "URL Problem Example"
    
    A URL like `example.com/user/john.smith@company.com/dashboard` contains email and is PII that automatically appears in analytics reports.

### Protection Methods in Analytics

=== "Hashing"

    **One-way hashing of sensitive data:**

    ```javascript
    // Safe email handling
    function hashEmail(email) {
        return CryptoJS.SHA256(email.toLowerCase().trim()).toString();
    }
    
    // Send hashed identifier
    analytics.track('user_signup', {
        'user_id_hashed': hashEmail(userEmail),
        'signup_source': 'website'
    });
    ```

=== "Pseudonymization"

    **Replace identifiers with pseudonyms:**

    - Generate random IDs instead of email
    - Use internal user_id
    - Create session tokens
    - Reversible only through protected database

=== "IP Anonymization"

    **Mask last octets:**

    - `192.168.1.100` → `192.168.1.0`
    - `2001:db8::1` → `2001:db8::`
    - Geographic accuracy reduced to city/region
    - GDPR compliance

### Consent and Management

**Tracking Categories:**

=== "Necessary"

    **Technically required for operation:**

    - Session cookies
    - Site security
    - Basic functionality
    - No consent required

=== "Analytics"

    **Performance measurement:**

    - Anonymized analytics
    - Aggregated metrics
    - A/B testing
    - Consent required

=== "Marketing"

    **Personalization and advertising:**

    - Behavioral targeting
    - Remarketing
    - Cross-site tracking
    - Explicit consent mandatory

**Consent Implementation:**

```javascript
// Check consent before tracking
function trackEvent(eventName, eventData) {
    if (hasConsent('analytics')) {
        // Full tracking with personal data
        analytics.track(eventName, eventData);
    } else if (hasConsent('essential')) {
        // Only anonymous aggregated data
        analytics.track(eventName, {
            'event_category': eventData.category,
            'consent_status': 'declined'
        });
    }
}
```

## Technical PII Protection
