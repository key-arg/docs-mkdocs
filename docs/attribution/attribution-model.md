# Attribution Models in Web Analytics: Complete Guide to Conversion Value Distribution

An attribution model determines which marketing channel gets credit for a conversion when users interact with a brand through multiple traffic sources. This is a critically important mechanism for understanding the effectiveness of different acquisition channels and optimizing marketing budgets.

In modern web analytics, simple scenarios where users see an ad and immediately make a purchase are rare. On average, seven touchpoints are needed for a purchase, with each channel having more or less influence on the user's decision. Attribution models help fairly distribute value across all stages of the user's path to conversion.

## Core Attribution Principles

An attribution model is an algorithm by which an analytics system assigns a conversion, or achievement of a specific goal, to a particular marketing channel. The entire conversion path is taken as 100%, and each interaction point receives a value from 0 to 100% depending on the chosen model.

!!! info "User Journey Example"
    
    **Scenario:** Online course purchase
    
    1. **Search query** → blog visit (Organic Search)
    2. **Social network** → ad view, subscription (Paid Social)  
    3. **Email newsletter** → discount received (Email Marketing)
    4. **Direct visit** → final purchase (Direct)
    
    Each attribution model will distribute the value of this conversion differently across the four channels.

### Types of Attribution Models

All attribution models fall into two main categories:

=== "Single-Touch Models"

    **Characteristics:**

    - Assign 100% value to one channel
    - Simple to understand and implement
    - Ignore other interactions
    - Suitable for short sales cycles

=== "Multi-Touch Models"

    **Characteristics:**

    - Distribute value across multiple channels
    - More complex but realistic
    - Consider the entire user journey
    - Optimal for long sales cycles

## Single-Touch Attribution Models

### First-Touch Attribution

The model assigns 100% of conversion value to the first channel of user interaction.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Organic Search<br/>100%] --> B[Paid Social<br/>0%]
    B --> C[Email<br/>0%]
    C --> D[Direct<br/>0%]
    D --> E[Conversion]
    
    style A fill:#4CAF50,stroke:#333,stroke-width:3px,color:#fff
    style B fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#ddd
    style C fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#ddd
    style D fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#ddd
```

**Optimal Application:**

!!! tip "When to Use First-Touch"

    - **New audience acquisition campaigns:** evaluating the effectiveness of brand introduction channels
    - **Content marketing:** analyzing primary traffic sources
    - **Branding campaigns:** understanding awareness-building channels

**Limitations:** The model overvalues the role of top-funnel channels and completely ignores the influence of nurturing channels on purchase decisions.

### Last-Touch Attribution

Last click attribution can still be found in Google Analytics — the model name and logic will be the same as in other analytical systems. The model assigns all conversion value to the last channel before the target action.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Organic Search<br/>0%] --> B[Paid Social<br/>0%]
    B --> C[Email<br/>0%]
    C --> D[Direct<br/>100%]
    D --> E[Conversion]
    
    style A fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#ddd
    style B fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#ddd
    style C fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#ddd
    style D fill:#4CAF50,stroke:#333,stroke-width:3px,color:#fff
```

**Advantages:**

- Simplicity of implementation and understanding
- Focus on channels that directly lead to conversion
- Standard for most analytics platforms

**Disadvantages:** Last click is not suitable for companies with many advertising sources. Large marketing budgets, complex user acquisition scenarios, long deal cycles — this model will not show the real picture of what's happening.

### Last Non-Direct Click

An improved version of the last-touch model that excludes direct visits and assigns value to the second-to-last marketing channel.

!!! note "Logic of Excluding Direct Traffic"
    
    **Problem:** Users often return to the site via direct visit after getting acquainted through advertising
    
    **Solution:** The model ignores Direct and gives value to the last measurable marketing channel
    
    **Result:** More accurate assessment of paid acquisition channel effectiveness

## Multi-Touch Attribution Models

### Linear Attribution

Evenly distributes conversion value among all touchpoints in the user journey.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Organic Search<br/>25%] --> B[Paid Social<br/>25%]
    B --> C[Email<br/>25%]
    C --> D[Direct<br/>25%]
    D --> E[Conversion]
    
    style A fill:#2196F3,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
    style B fill:#2196F3,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
    style C fill:#2196F3,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
    style D fill:#2196F3,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
```

**Application:** The model is suitable for understanding the overall contribution of all channels and identifying undervalued traffic sources.

**Limitation:** Not all touchpoints have equal influence on purchase decisions, so even distribution may be inaccurate.

### Time-Decay Attribution

Assigns greater weight to touchpoints that occurred closer to conversion. Each previous channel receives exponentially less value.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Organic Search<br/>10%] --> B[Paid Social<br/>20%]
    B --> C[Email<br/>30%]
    C --> D[Direct<br/>40%]
    D --> E[Conversion]
    
    style A fill:#FFC107,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    style B fill:#FF9800,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1.5px
    style C fill:#FF5722,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
    style D fill:#F44336,stroke:#333,stroke-width:3px,color:#fff
```

!!! example "Practical Time-Decay Example"
    
    **B2B software purchase (3-month cycle):**
    
    - **Month 1:** Google search (research) → 5%
    - **Month 2:** LinkedIn advertising (comparison) → 15% 
    - **Month 3:** Email with commercial offer → 35%
    - **Final:** Direct visit for purchase → 45%

**Optimal Application:** Long sales cycles, B2B segment, expensive goods with lengthy decision-making processes.

### Position-Based Attribution (U-shaped model)

Distributes 40% of value to first touch, 40% to last touch, remaining 20% evenly among intermediate points.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Organic Search<br/>40%] --> B[Paid Social<br/>10%]
    B --> C[Email<br/>10%]
    C --> D[Direct<br/>40%]
    D --> E[Conversion]
    
    style A fill:#9C27B0,stroke:#333,stroke-width:3px,color:#fff
    style B fill:#E1BEE7,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    style C fill:#E1BEE7,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    style D fill:#9C27B0,stroke:#333,stroke-width:3px,color:#fff
```

**Model Logic:** Recognizes the critical importance of acquisition (awareness) and conversion (decision) channels while considering the role of nurturing channels.

**Ideal Scenarios:**

- E-commerce with active retargeting
- SaaS products with trial periods
- Services with lengthy consideration cycles

### W-Shaped Attribution

Evolution of the U-shaped model with addition of a third key point — lead generation moment. Distributes 30% each among first touch, lead creation, and conversion.

| Stage | Value Share | Rationale |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| First touch | 30% | Attention attraction |
| Lead creation | 30% | Interest manifestation |
| Conversion | 30% | Decision making |
| Other touches | 10% | Process support |

**Application:** B2B companies with clear Sales Funnel stages where lead generation is a separate measurable goal.

### Data-Driven Attribution

Data-driven attribution uses machine learning to analyze historical data and determine the real impact of each channel on conversion.

**Working Principle:**

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Historical conversion<br/>data] --> B{Pattern analysis<br/>ML algorithms}
    B --> C[Identifying significant<br/>correlations]
    C --> D[Calculating weight<br/>coefficients]
    D --> E[Personalized<br/>attribution model]
```

**Implementation Requirements:**

!!! warning "Minimum Requirements"
    
    **Data Volume:** Minimum 15,000 clicks and 600 conversions over 30 days for statistical significance
    
    **Technical Infrastructure:** Advanced analytics platforms with ML capabilities
    
    **Expertise:** Data science team for setup and result interpretation

**Advantages:** Maximum accuracy through accounting for unique business characteristics and audience behavior.

**Limitations:** High implementation complexity, requirement for large data volumes, "black box" for understanding distribution logic.
