# Time-Decay Attribution: temporal decay model in web analytics

Time-Decay Attribution is a multi-channel attribution model that distributes conversion value across all touchpoints in the customer journey, giving greater weight to interactions that occurred closer to the conversion moment. Unlike simple single-touch models, Time-Decay accounts for the reality of modern marketing, where customers interact with brands multiple times before making a purchase decision.

The core idea of the model is that recent touches have greater influence on conversion than those that occurred several weeks ago. This is particularly relevant for scenarios where temporal proximity is critically important — for example, in limited-time promotional campaigns or impulse purchases.

## How Time-Decay Attribution Works

### Half-Life Concept

The mechanics of Time-Decay Attribution are based on the concept of **half-life** — an idea borrowed from physics that describes the time it takes for a marketing touchpoint's influence to diminish by half.

!!! info "Mathematical Model"

    Formula for calculating touchpoint weight in Time-Decay Attribution:
    
    ```
    Weight = 2^(-t/half-life)
    ```
    
    where **t** is the number of days between the touchpoint and conversion, and **half-life** is the configurable half-life parameter.

### Weight Distribution Principles

**Temporal sensitivity** determines how strongly time influences value distribution. Touchpoints occurring immediately before conversion receive maximum weight, while earlier interactions receive proportionally less.

**Decay function** applies gradual value reduction as the temporal gap between touchpoint and conversion increases. This ensures smooth weight transitions between touchpoints instead of abrupt jumps.

!!! example "Weight Distribution Example"

    **Customer Journey (7 days):**
    
    - Day 1: Google Ads (search advertising) → 10%
    - Day 3: Facebook (organic post) → 20%
    - Day 6: Email campaign → 30%
    - Day 7: Direct visit → 40%
    
    **Half-life: 7 days**
    
    An interaction occurring 7 days before conversion receives half the weight of a touchpoint on the conversion day.

## Comparison with Other Attribution Models

### Time-Decay vs Linear Attribution

Linear Attribution distributes value evenly across all touchpoints, while Time-Decay gives greater weight to recent interactions. The linear model assumes all touches are equally important, which doesn't always correspond to purchasing behavior reality.

=== "Linear Attribution"

    **Characteristics:**
    
    - Equal value distribution
    - Simple to understand and implement
    - Doesn't account for temporal importance of touches
    - Suitable for analyzing overall channel contribution

=== "Time-Decay Attribution"

    **Characteristics:**
    
    - Priority to recent interactions
    - Accounts for temporal proximity to conversion
    - Configurable half-life period
    - Ideal for campaigns with urgency component

### Time-Decay vs Position-Based

Position-Based model assigns 40% value to first and last touches, distributing the remaining 20% among intermediate points. Time-Decay provides smoother weight distribution without fixed percentages.

## Setting Up Time-Decay Attribution

### Determining Half-Life Period

Marketers typically configure half-life in Time-Decay models according to their products' or services' sales cycle. Choosing the correct half-life period is critically important for model accuracy.

!!! tip "Half-Life Configuration Recommendations"

    **Short Sales Cycles (B2C):**
    
    - E-commerce: 1-3 days
    - Impulse purchases: 12-24 hours
    - Service subscriptions: 3-7 days
    
    **Long Sales Cycles (B2B):**
    
    - SaaS solutions: 14-30 days
    - Enterprise sales: 30-90 days
    - Consulting services: 7-21 days

### Lookback Window Configuration

**Lookback window** determines how far back in time the attribution model will search for touchpoints to associate with a conversion. Various types of lookback windows exist, such as visit lookback window, which looks at the beginning of the visit/touchpoint where conversion occurred.

| Lookback Window Type | Description | Recommended Use |
|---------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Visit-based | From session start to conversion | Intra-session behavior analysis |
| Time-based | Fixed period (7, 14, 30 days) | Standard marketing analysis |
| Custom | Configurable period | Specific business scenarios |

    - Normalize weights to 100%

## Urgency Modeling in Time-Decay Attribution

### Adaptation for Urgent Campaigns

Time-Decay Attribution is particularly effective for understanding which channels secure conversions within shorter timeframes. Urgency modeling allows adapting the model for specific scenarios where temporal factor plays a decisive role.

!!! warning "Promotional Campaign Settings"

    For short-term campaigns (24-48 hours), it's recommended to:
    
    - Reduce half-life to 1-2 days
    - Decrease lookback window to 7 days
    - Increase weight of last 24 hours before conversion
    - Exclude interactions older than one week

### Seasonal Adjustments

**Holiday periods** require special approaches to Time-Decay model configuration. During high purchasing activity periods, consumer behavior changes, which should be reflected in attribution parameters.

**Adjustments for different periods:**

- Black Friday: half-life 6-12 hours
- New Year holidays: half-life 2-3 days
- Back-to-school season: half-life 3-7 days
- Regular periods: standard settings

## Applications Across Industries

## Optimization Based on Time-Decay Attribution

### Budget Planning

Time-Decay Attribution provides a more accurate picture for marketing budget allocation. Channels receiving high weight in the model should be considered for increased investment.

**Budget optimization strategies:**

**Increasing budget for high-impact channels**

   - Channels with high Time-Decay weight
   - Sources with short time-to-conversion
   - Campaigns with high urgency component

**Redistributing from low-impact channels**

   - Channels with low weight in final stage
   - Sources only for awareness
   - Campaigns with long lag between touch and conversion

### Creative Optimization

**Message adaptation for temporal proximity:**

- **Early-stage touchpoints:** Brand awareness, educational content
- **Mid-stage interactions:** Product benefits, case studies
- **Late-stage touchpoints:** Urgency messaging, limited-time offers

### Timing Optimization

Integrating Time-Decay into marketing analytics frameworks enables creating more flexible and responsive marketing strategies.

**Optimal timing for various channels:**

| Channel | Optimal Touch Timing | Urgency Level |
|---------|---------------------|---------------|
| Email | 2-24 hours before conversion | High |
| Paid Social | 1-3 days before conversion | Medium |
| Organic Search | 1-7 days before conversion | Low |
| Display Retargeting | 6-48 hours before conversion | Very High |
