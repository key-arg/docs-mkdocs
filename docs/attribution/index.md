# Attribution & Marketing Measurement

Advanced methodologies for understanding how different marketing touchpoints contribute to conversions and measuring the true impact of marketing efforts across the customer journey.

## Attribution Models

### Single-Touch Attribution

- **[Last-Click Attribution](last-click-attribution.md)** — Assigns full credit to the final interaction before conversion
- **[First-Click Attribution](first-click-attribution.md)** — Credits the initial touchpoint that started the customer journey

### Multi-Touch Attribution

- **[Linear Attribution](linear-attribution.md)** — Distributes conversion credit equally across all touchpoints
- **[Time-Decay Attribution](time-decay-attribution.md)** — Gives more credit to interactions closer to conversion
- **[Position-Based Attribution](position-based-attribution.md)** — U-shaped model emphasizing first and last touches
- **[Data-Driven Attribution](data-driven-attribution.md)** — Machine learning approach using historical data patterns
- **[Multi-Touch Attribution](multi-touch-attribution.md)** — Comprehensive analysis of all customer touchpoints

## Advanced Attribution Concepts

### Conversion Types

- **[View-Through Conversions](view-through-conversions.md)** — Actions taken after seeing ads without clicking
- **[Click-Through Attribution](click-through-attribution.md)** — Credit assignment for clicked advertisements
- **[Post-View Post-Click](post-view-post-click.md)** — Delayed conversions after multiple interaction types
- **[Cross-Device Conversions](cross-device-conversions.md)** — Attribution across multiple devices and platforms

### Measurement Parameters

- **[Lookback Window](lookback-window.md)** — Time frame considered for attribution analysis
- **[Conversion Lag](conversion-lag.md)** — Delay between marketing interaction and conversion
- **[Attribution Models](attribution-model.md)** — Framework for credit assignment and model selection

## Marketing Mix & Incrementality

### Holistic Measurement

- **[Marketing Mix Modeling](marketing-mix-modeling.md)** — Econometric analysis of all marketing channels
- **[Incrementality](incrementality.md)** — Measuring additional value generated by marketing efforts

### Experimental Design

- **[Lift Study](lift-study.md)** — Controlled experiments measuring campaign uplift
- **[Geo Experiment](geo-experiment.md)** — Location-based testing methodologies
- **[Holdout](holdout.md)** — Control groups excluded from marketing exposure
- **[Matched Market Test](matched-market-test.md)** — Comparing performance between similar markets

!!! info "Attribution Challenges"
    Modern attribution faces significant challenges including cross-device tracking limitations, privacy regulations, walled garden data restrictions, and the complexity of B2B customer journeys that can span months or years.

!!! tip "Implementation Strategy"
    Start with simple attribution models to establish baselines, then gradually implement more sophisticated approaches. Combine multiple measurement methods for comprehensive understanding of marketing effectiveness.

!!! warning "Data Quality Requirements"
    Accurate attribution requires consistent tracking implementation, proper UTM parameter usage, cross-domain tracking setup, and regular data validation to ensure measurement reliability.
