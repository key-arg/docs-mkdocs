# Lookback Window

The lookback window (also known as attribution window or conversion window) is a critical parameter in attribution modeling that defines the time period during which marketing touchpoints are considered eligible to receive credit for conversions. This temporal boundary fundamentally shapes how marketing performance is measured and optimized across different channels and campaigns.

## What is a Lookback Window?

A lookback window specifies the maximum time interval between a marketing touchpoint (such as an ad click, impression, or email open) and a conversion event during which the touchpoint can be credited with influencing that conversion. It essentially answers the question: "How far back in time should we look to find marketing activities that contributed to this conversion?"

### Key Components

- **Start Point**: The conversion event timestamp
- **End Point**: The earliest marketing touchpoint eligible for attribution
- **Duration**: The time span between start and end points
- **Event Types**: Which touchpoints are included (clicks, impressions, emails, etc.)

## Types of Lookback Windows

### 1. Click-Through Lookback Windows
Measures the time between a click and subsequent conversion:
```
Click-Through Attribution Flow:
Day 1: User clicks search ad
Day 2: User browses website
Day 3: User makes purchase
Result: If lookback window ≥ 2 days, search ad receives credit
```

**Typical Duration Settings**:
- **Search Ads**: 30-90 days
- **Social Media**: 7-28 days
- **Display Ads**: 30-90 days
- **Email Marketing**: 7-30 days

### 2. View-Through Lookback Windows
Tracks time between an impression (without click) and conversion:
```
View-Through Attribution Flow:
Day 1: User sees display ad (no click)
Day 2: User searches for product
Day 3: User converts directly
Result: If view-through window ≥ 2 days, display ad receives credit
```

**Typical Duration Settings**:
- **Display Impressions**: 1-14 days
- **Video Ads**: 1-30 days
- **Social Media**: 1-7 days
- **Connected TV**: 1-14 days

### 3. Engagement-Based Windows
Vary duration based on interaction depth:
```
Engagement-Based Windows:
├── Email Open: 7 days
├── Email Click: 30 days
├── Video 25% View: 3 days
├── Video 75% View: 14 days
└── Full Video View: 30 days
```

## Setting Optimal Lookback Windows

### 1. Data-Driven Approach

#### Historical Analysis Method
```python
# Pseudo-code for window optimization
def analyze_conversion_delays(conversion_data):
    delays = []
    for conversion in conversion_data:
        touchpoints = get_touchpoints_before_conversion(conversion)
        for touchpoint in touchpoints:
            delay = conversion.timestamp - touchpoint.timestamp
            delays.append(delay)
    
    # Analyze distribution
    percentiles = calculate_percentiles(delays, [50, 75, 90, 95])
    
    # Recommend windows based on coverage
    recommendations = {
        'conservative': percentiles[75],  # Covers 75% of conversions
        'balanced': percentiles[90],     # Covers 90% of conversions
        'aggressive': percentiles[95]    # Covers 95% of conversions
    }
    
    return recommendations
```

#### Conversion Path Analysis
```
Conversion Path Methodology:
├── Step 1: Identify all conversion events
├── Step 2: Map all preceding touchpoints
├── Step 3: Calculate time delays for each touchpoint
├── Step 4: Analyze delay distribution by channel
├── Step 5: Determine optimal windows by coverage percentage
└── Step 6: Test and validate window settings
```

    reasoning: "Direct intent, quick decisions"
  
  Display:
    click_window: 30 days
    view_window: 7 days
    reasoning: "Awareness building, longer consideration"
  
  Social:
    click_window: 14 days
    view_window: 1 day
    reasoning: "Social proof, shorter attention spans"
  
  Email:
    click_window: 7 days
    view_window: 1 day

## Conclusion

Lookback windows are fundamental to accurate attribution measurement and effective marketing optimization. The optimal window length depends on business model characteristics, customer journey complexity, and channel-specific factors. Success requires balancing comprehensive measurement with attribution accuracy while avoiding common pitfalls like over- or under-attribution.

As the marketing landscape continues to evolve with privacy regulations and platform changes, organizations must adapt their lookback window strategies to maintain measurement effectiveness. Regular testing, data-driven optimization, and alignment with business objectives ensure that lookback windows support rather than hinder marketing performance.

The future of lookback windows lies in intelligent, dynamic systems that automatically optimize window lengths based on real-time performance data while respecting user privacy and maintaining measurement accuracy across all marketing channels.
