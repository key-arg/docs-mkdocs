# DAU/WAU/MAU: Active User Metrics for Measuring Engagement

**DAU (Daily Active Users)**, **WAU (Weekly Active Users)**, and **MAU (Monthly Active Users)** are key active user metrics that measure the number of unique users interacting with a product over a specific time period. These metrics form the foundation for analyzing engagement, growth, and health of digital products, from mobile applications to SaaS platforms.

## Definitions and Calculation

### DAU - Daily Active Users

DAU measures the number of unique users who interact with a product within one day (24 hours).

```
DAU = Number of unique active users per day
```

**Calculation methods:**

- **Calendar day**: From 00:00 to 23:59 in a specific timezone
- **Rolling window**: Last 24 hours from calculation time
- **Average DAU**: Sum of DAU over period / number of days

### WAU - Weekly Active Users

WAU shows the number of unique users active during a week (7 days).

```
WAU = Number of unique active users per week
```

!!! warning "Important Clarification"
    
    WAU ‚â† Sum of DAU for 7 days. A user who visited multiple days in a week is counted in WAU only once.

### MAU - Monthly Active Users

MAU reflects the number of unique users over a month (30 days or calendar month).

```
MAU = Number of unique active users per month
```

**Counting variations:**

- Calendar month (1st-31st)
- Rolling 30 days
- 28-day period (4 full weeks)

## Defining "Active User"

### Activity Criteria by Product Type

The key aspect is defining what counts as "activity" for your product:

| Product Type | Activity Examples | Threshold Values |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Social Networks** | Feed viewing, likes, comments | Any interaction |
| **E-commerce** | Product browsing, cart additions, purchases | >30 seconds on site |
| **B2B SaaS** | Login, feature usage | Active session >1 minute |
| **Media** | Video viewing, article reading | Content consumption >10 seconds |
| **Games** | Game launch, level completion | Game session >2 minutes |
| **Fintech** | Balance check, transaction | Any app action |

!!! info "Activity Definition Example"
    
    For a streaming platform, an active user might be someone who:

    - Option 1: Simply opened the app
    - Option 2: Started viewing content
    - Option 3: Watched at least 1 minute of video
    
    The choice of criteria significantly impacts metrics (difference can reach 30-50%)

## Trend Analysis and Dynamics

### Growth Patterns

Analyzing DAU/WAU/MAU dynamics helps understand product development trajectory:

=== "Healthy Growth"
    
    **Characteristics:**

    - All three metrics grow proportionally
    - DAU/MAU ratio stable or growing
    - WAU shows steady trend
    
    **Dynamics chart:**
    ```
    MAU: ‚ÜóÔ∏è Stable growth 10-15% m/m
    WAU: ‚ÜóÔ∏è Correlates with MAU
    DAU: ‚ÜóÔ∏è Growing faster than MAU
    ```

=== "Retention Problems"
    
    **Characteristics:**

    - MAU grows but DAU stagnates
    - Declining DAU/MAU ratio
    - WAU volatile
    
    **Dynamics chart:**
    ```
    MAU: ‚ÜóÔ∏è Growth from new users
    WAU: ‚ÜîÔ∏è Unstable dynamics
    DAU: ‚ÜòÔ∏è Declining engagement
    ```

=== "Seasonal Fluctuations"
    
    **Characteristics:**

    - Predictable peaks and troughs
    - Pattern cyclicality
    - Correlation with external factors
    
    **Dynamics chart:**
    ```
    MAU: „Ä∞Ô∏è Wave-like dynamics
    WAU: „Ä∞Ô∏è Follows MAU with delay
    DAU: üìä Sharp peaks on specific days
    ```

### Data Smoothing

Smoothing methods are used to identify trends:

**7-day moving average for DAU:**
```
DAU_MA7 = (DAU‚ÇÅ + DAU‚ÇÇ + ... + DAU‚Çá) / 7
```

**Advantages:**

- Removes weekly seasonality
- Identifies long-term trends
- Reduces anomaly impact

## Industry Benchmarks

### General Standards by Category

| Category | Typical DAU | Typical WAU | Typical MAU | DAU/MAU |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Social Networks** | 10-50M | 50-200M | 100-500M | 40-60% |
| **Messengers** | 50-500M | 200-800M | 500-1500M | 50-70% |
| **Games (Casual)** | 100K-1M | 500K-5M | 2M-20M | 15-25% |
| **E-commerce** | 50K-500K | 200K-2M | 1M-10M | 10-15% |
| **B2B SaaS** | 5K-50K | 20K-200K | 50K-500K | 30-40% |
| **Media/News** | 100K-5M | 500K-20M | 2M-50M | 20-30% |
| **Fintech** | 10K-100K | 50K-500K | 200K-2M | 15-20% |

!!! note "Context Matters More Than Absolute Numbers"
    
    Comparison with competitors in your niche is more important than achieving abstract goals. A SaaS with 10K MAU can be more successful than a social network with 1M MAU in its segment.

### Benchmark Evolution

**Historical changes in average metrics:**

- **2014**: Average DAU/MAU for successful apps ‚Äî 10-20%
- **2017**: Increased to 15-25% with mobile usage growth
- **2020**: Pandemic raised average to 25-35%
- **2024**: New norm ‚Äî 30-40% for digital products

## Ratios and Derived Metrics

### DAU/MAU Ratio (Stickiness)

Shows product "stickiness" ‚Äî what proportion of monthly users use the product daily:

```
Stickiness = (DAU / MAU) √ó 100%
```

**Interpretation:**

- <10%: Episodic usage
- 10-20%: Low engagement
- 20-40%: Medium engagement
- 40-60%: High engagement
- >60%: Daily habit

### DAU/WAU and WAU/MAU Ratios

Additional coefficients for understanding usage patterns:

| Metric | Formula | What it shows | Norm |
|--------|---------|---------------|------|
| DAU/WAU | (DAU/WAU)√ó100% | Daily usage within week | 40-60% |
| WAU/MAU | (WAU/MAU)√ó100% | Weekly activity | 60-80% |
| L21+/28 | Active 21+ days of 28 | Super-active users | 15-30% |

### Selecting Key Metric

Algorithm for choosing main tracking metric:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Product usage frequency] --> B{DAU/WAU > 60%?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Focus on DAU]
    B -->|No| D{WAU/MAU > 60%?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Focus on WAU]
    D -->|No| F[Focus on MAU]
```

!!! tip "Practical Rule"
    
    - If DAU/WAU > 60% ‚Äî daily use product, track DAU
    - If WAU/MAU > 60% ‚Äî weekly pattern, focus on WAU
    - Otherwise ‚Äî monthly MAU metric will be most representative
