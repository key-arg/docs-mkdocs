# Exit Rate

**Exit Rate** is a key web analytics metric that measures the percentage of sessions that ended on a specific page. Unlike bounce rate, which only considers single-page sessions, exit rate analyzes all sessions where a particular page was the last one viewed before leaving the site, regardless of how many pages were viewed before it.

## Definition

In the context of analytics systems, such as our analytics counter, *exit rate* is calculated as the ratio of exits from a specific page to the total number of pageviews of that page. An exit is recorded when:

- The user closes the browser tab or window
- The user navigates to a different website
- The session times out (typically after 30 minutes of inactivity)
- The user types a new URL or uses bookmarks to leave

It's important to understand that **every session** has an exit page—the last page viewed before leaving. A high exit rate on certain pages may be completely normal (such as thank you pages or contact information pages).

!!! tip "Tip for Beginners"
    If you're analyzing exit rates, remember: context matters. A high exit rate on a checkout confirmation page is expected and positive. However, a high exit rate in the middle of a conversion funnel may indicate problems that need addressing.

## Difference from Other Metrics

To better understand exit rate, let's compare it with related metrics:

- **[Bounce Rate](bounce-rate.md)**: Percentage of single-page sessions. Bounces are always exits, but not all exits are bounces.
- **Pageviews (просмотры страниц)**: Total number of times a page was viewed. Used as the denominator in exit rate calculation.
- **Engagement Rate (уровень вовлеченности)**: The opposite of bounce rate, showing sessions with meaningful interaction.

| Metric | What it Measures | Example Usage |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Exit Rate** | Percentage of sessions ending on a page | Identifying problematic pages in user flow |
| **Bounce Rate** | Percentage of single-interaction sessions | Evaluating landing page effectiveness |
| **Pageviews** | Total page loads | Measuring content popularity |

## How Exit Rate Works in Practice

For webmasters and analysts, understanding exit rate helps optimize user journeys. Consider an e-commerce site with these pages: Homepage → Category → Product → Cart → Checkout. If the Cart page has a 70% exit rate, it signals that most users abandon their purchase at this stage.

Common scenarios and their interpretations:

1. High exit rate on blog articles (60-80%) — Normal, users found the information they needed
2. High exit rate on product pages (>50%) — May indicate pricing issues, lack of trust signals, or poor product descriptions
3. High exit rate on form pages (>40%) — Often suggests the form is too complex or technical issues exist

To track exit rate effectively, install our analytics counter code on every page. The system automatically calculates this metric based on user navigation patterns.

!!! info "Example"
    A product page received 1,000 pageviews in a week. Of these views, 450 were the last page users visited before leaving the site. Exit rate = 45%. This suggests that more than half of visitors continue browsing after viewing this product.

!!! info "Example"
    Your checkout process has three steps. Step 2 shows a 65% exit rate while Steps 1 and 3 have 20% and 10% respectively. This clearly identifies Step 2 as the bottleneck requiring immediate attention—perhaps simplifying form fields or adding progress indicators.

## Factors Influencing the Metric

Various factors affect exit rate values, and understanding them is crucial for accurate analysis:

- **Page Purpose**: Naturally high exit rates occur on pages designed to be endpoints (confirmation pages, contact details, downloadable resources).
- **Content Quality**: Poor content, outdated information, or missing details drive users away prematurely.
- **User Experience**: Slow loading times, broken links, intrusive pop-ups, or confusing navigation increase exits.
- **Call-to-Action Clarity**: Weak or missing CTAs leave users unsure of next steps, leading to site abandonment.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Non-responsive design or poor mobile experience causes higher exit rates on mobile devices.
- **External Links**: Pages with many external links naturally have higher exit rates as users follow these links.

Analyzing exit rate alongside other metrics provides deeper insights. Combine it with:

- **Time on Page**: High exit rate with high time on page may indicate satisfied users
- **Scroll Depth**: Understanding how far users scroll before exiting
- **Device Segmentation**: Exit rates often vary significantly between desktop and mobile

Our analytics tool allows you to segment exit rate data by traffic source, device type, and user demographics for more actionable insights. Regular monitoring helps identify trends and optimization opportunities in your site's user flow.
