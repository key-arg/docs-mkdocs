# Behavioral Targeting: Data-Driven Personalization

**Behavioral Targeting** is a method of personalizing content and advertising based on analyzing users' online behavior, including browsing history, search queries, clicks, and content interactions. This technology enables creating more relevant user experiences but also raises important privacy and ethical questions, especially in the context of GDPR and other data protection regulations.

## Behavioral Targeting Fundamentals

### Operating Principles

Behavioral targeting is based on collecting and analyzing users' digital footprints:

1. **Data collection**: Tracking user actions through cookies, pixels, SDKs
2. **Pattern analysis**: Identifying interests and preferences based on behavior
3. **Segmentation**: Grouping users by similar characteristics
4. **Personalization**: Displaying relevant content or advertising

### Types of Collected Data

| Data Category | Examples | Usage |
|---------------|----------|-------|
| **Navigational** | Pages visited, time on site | Interest determination |
| **Transactional** | Purchases, cart additions | Intent prediction |
| **Search** | Queries, filters | Needs understanding |
| **Interactions** | Clicks, scrolling, hover | Engagement assessment |
| **Contextual** | Device, geolocation, time | Delivery optimization |
| **Social** | Likes, shares, comments | Preference analysis |

!!! info "Key Distinction"
    
    Unlike contextual advertising based on the content of the viewed page, behavioral targeting uses historical information about user actions regardless of current content.

## Technologies and Implementation Methods

### Tracking Technologies

=== "First-party cookies"
    
    **Characteristics:**

    - Set by website owner
    - Accessible only on setting domain
    - More privacy-reliable
    
    **Applications:**

    - Sessions and authentication
    - On-site personalization
    - Behavioral analytics

=== "Third-party cookies"
    
    **Characteristics:**

    - Set by external services
    - Cross-domain tracking
    - Gradually blocked by browsers
    
    **Applications:**

    - Retargeting
    - Audience segments
    - Attribution

=== "Fingerprinting"
    
    **Characteristics:**

    - No cookies required
    - Uses device characteristics
    - Harder to block
    
    **Applications:**

    - Cookieless identification
    - Fraud detection
    - Cross-device matching

### Segmentation Algorithms

**Rule-based segmentation:**
```
IF (visited_category = "Sports" AND views > 5)
THEN segment = "Sports_enthusiasts"
```

**Machine Learning approaches:**

- Clustering (K-means, DBSCAN)
- Classification (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Deep Learning (RNN for action sequences)
- Collaborative filtering

### User Profiling

Creating detailed profiles includes:

**Demographic attributes** (predicted):

- Age: 25-34 (75% probability)
- Gender: female (82% probability)
- Income: medium+ (68% probability)

**Interests and preferences:**

- Categories: Fashion (score: 0.8), Travel (0.6)
- Brands: premium segment preferences
- Content: video > text

**Behavioral characteristics:**

- Activity time: evening (19:00-22:00)
- Devices: mobile 70%, desktop 30%
- Visit frequency: 2-3 times per week

## Marketing Applications

### Content Personalization

**Dynamic Content Optimization:**

| Element | Standard Version | Personalized |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| Headline | "Welcome!" | "Specially for yoga lovers" |
| Hero image | Generic banner | Relevant category |
| Recommendations | Popular products | Based on history |
| CTA | "Browse catalog" | "Continue shopping" |
| Promo | General discount | Personal offer |

### Retargeting Strategies

**Behavioral retargeting scenarios:**

**Cart abandonment**

   - Trigger: item in cart >24 hours
   - Action: email + display advertising
   - Personalization: specific product + discount

**Browse abandonment**

   - Trigger: >3 category views
   - Action: similar products
   - Personalization: price range

**Post-purchase**

   - Trigger: completed purchase
   - Action: complementary products
   - Personalization: related items

### Email Personalization

Email campaign personalization levels:

**Basic level:**

- Recipient name
- Gender/age segmentation
- General recommendations

**Advanced level:**

- Dynamic content by interests
- Personalized send time
- Individual promo codes

**Hyper-personalization:**

- AI-generated content
- Predictive recommendations
- Real-time optimization

!!! tip "Best Practice"
    
    Research shows that personalized email campaigns based on behavioral data have 35-40% higher open rates and 50-60% higher CTR compared to mass mailings.

## Privacy and Regulatory Requirements

### GDPR and Behavioral Targeting

GDPR imposes strict requirements on behavioral data collection and use:

**Key GDPR principles:**

**Lawful basis**

   - Legal basis required (usually consent)
   - Legitimate interest rarely applicable for behavioral targeting
   - Consent must be explicit and informed

**Transparency**

   - Clear information about data collection
   - Purpose explanation
   - Third-party disclosure

**Data minimization**

   - Collect only necessary data
   - Storage limitation
   - Regular deletion of outdated data

### Cookie Consent Requirements

**Technical consent implementation:**

=== "Opt-in model (GDPR)"
    
    ```javascript
    // Check consent before setting cookies
    if (hasUserConsent('analytics')) {
        setAnalyticsCookies();
    }
    if (hasUserConsent('marketing')) {
        setMarketingCookies();
    }
    ```
    
    **Requirements:**
    - No cookies before consent
    - Granular category choice
    - Easy consent withdrawal

=== "Opt-out model (CCPA)"
    
    ```javascript
    // Set cookies by default
    setDefaultCookies();
    
    // Check opt-out signal
    if (userOptedOut()) {
        deleteCookies();
        disableTracking();
    }
    ```
    
    **Requirements:**

    - Visible "Do Not Sell" link
    - Respect for GPC signals
    - Data deletion on request

### Compliance Checklist

**To meet requirements, it's necessary to:**

- [ ] Implement consent mechanism
- [ ] Ensure data collection transparency
- [ ] Document all processing purposes
- [ ] Implement data deletion processes
- [ ] Conduct regular audits
- [ ] Train personnel on requirements
- [ ] Prepare procedures for user requests
- [ ] Execute DPAs with third parties

!!! warning "Violation Penalties"
    
    - GDPR: up to 4% of global turnover or €20 million
    - CCPA/CPRA: up to $7,500 per violation
    - Reputational risks may exceed financial ones
