# Cross-Domain Tracking: Linking User Sessions Across Multiple Domains

Cross-domain tracking is a technology for monitoring user activity as they navigate between different domains, allowing you to combine fragmented sessions into a unified view of the customer journey. Without proper cross-domain tracking setup, each user transition to a new domain is registered as a separate session from a new visitor, leading to distorted analytics data.

## The Data Fragmentation Problem

Cookies used for user identification in web analytics are bound to a specific domain and cannot be automatically read by other domains for security reasons. This creates a fundamental problem for businesses with multi-domain architecture.

!!! example "Typical E-commerce Scenario"
    
    An online store on `example-store.com` uses a third-party payment service on `payment-provider.com`:
    
    **Without cross-domain tracking:**

    - User from advertising campaign: session #1 on main site
    - Transition to payment: session #2 on payment domain
    - Result: 2 different users, lost conversion attribution
    
    **With cross-domain tracking:**

    - Single session across both domains
    - Preserved traffic source
    - Correct transaction attribution to advertising campaign

### Consequences of Missing Cross-Domain Tracking

| Metric | Distortion | Business Impact |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| User Count | Inflated by 40-60% | Incorrect audience size estimation |
| Sessions | Duplicated at each transition | Skewed engagement picture |
| Traffic Sources | Lost original source | Misallocated marketing budget |
| Conversions | Attribution to direct traffic | Undervalued campaign effectiveness |
| Bounce Rate | Artificially inflated | False signals about traffic quality |

## How Cross-Domain Tracking Works

Cross-domain tracking operates by passing user identifiers through URL parameters when navigating between domains. Cookies maintain the same IDs as they are passed from one domain to another via a URL parameter (_gl) when users navigate between domains through links or forms.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant A as Domain A
    participant B as Domain B
    participant GA as Analytics
    
    U->>A: Page visit
    A->>GA: Create Client ID
    A->>A: Store _ga cookie
    U->>A: Click link to Domain B
    A->>B: Pass ID via _gl parameter
    B->>B: Extract Client ID
    B->>GA: Continue same session
```

### System Components

=== "Linker (source)"
    
    **Functions:**
    
    - Track clicks on cross-domain links
    - Generate _gl parameter with encrypted Client ID
    - Automatically append parameter to URL
    - Handle forms and redirects
    
    **Features:**
    
    - Linker parameters expire after two minutes, so the parameter is only added at click time
    - Multiple domain support
    - Works with dynamically created links

=== "Acceptor (destination)"
    
    **Functions:**
    
    - Parse incoming _gl parameter
    - Validate timestamp
    - Restore Client ID
    - Overwrite local cookie
    
    **Features:**
    
    - Automatic rejection of expired parameters
    - Data integrity verification
    - Preserve original traffic source

## Google Analytics 4 Setup

GA4 has significantly simplified the cross-domain tracking setup process compared to Universal Analytics. In Google Analytics 4, configuration is done through the admin interface, eliminating confusion with code-level or GTM setup.

### Step-by-Step Configuration

!!! info "Setup Requirements"
    
    - Editor rights in GA4 property
    - Same Measurement ID on all domains
    - Access to code on all tracked domains
    - Maximum 100 domain conditions

**Configuration Process:**

**Navigate to Data Stream Settings**

   - Open Admin → Data Streams
   - Select web data stream
   - Click "Configure tag settings"

**Add Domains**

   - In Settings section, select "Configure your domains"
   - If using same Google tag across domains, they're automatically detected and appear in Recommendations
   - Manually add domains via "Add condition"

**Configure Match Conditions**

   | Match Type | Example | What It Includes |
   |-------------------|--------|--------------|
   | Contains | example.com | All subdomains and paths |
   | Exact match | shop.example.com | Only exact domain |
   | Starts with | secure. | All domains with prefix |
   | Ends with | .example.com | Main and subdomains |
   | Regex | ^(shop\|pay)\.example | Complex patterns |

### Google Tag Manager Setup

For more flexible management, many specialists prefer using GTM:

```javascript
// Google Tag configuration with cross-domain
gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX', {
  'linker': {
    'domains': ['example.com', 'checkout.example.com', 'payment-provider.com']
  }
});
```

!!! tip "GTM Approach Advantages"
    
    - Centralized management for multiple domains
    - Conditional activation logic
    - Change versioning
    - Pre-publish testing
    - Integration with other tags

## Testing and Debugging

Proper setup verification is critical for data reliability. To verify, open a page with a link to the second domain, click it, and ensure the URL contains the _gl parameter, for example: https://www.example.com/?_gl=1*abcde5*.

### Verification Methods

=== "Quick Check"
    
    **Steps:**
    
    1. Open first domain in incognito mode
    2. Navigate via link to second domain
    3. Check for `_gl` parameter in URL
    4. Open developer console
    5. Check `_ga` cookie value on both domains
    
    **Success Indicators:**
    
    - ✓ _gl parameter present
    - ✓ _ga cookie values identical
    - ✓ Session continues in GA4

=== "Detailed Debugging"
    
    **Tools:**
    
    - GA4 DebugView for real-time verification
    - Tag Assistant for tag validation
    - Network tab for request analysis
    - Cookie inspector for value checking
    
    **What to Verify:**
    
    - Client ID consistency
    - Session ID preservation
    - Traffic source attribution
    - Event parameter passing

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Missing _gl parameter | Incorrect domain configuration | Verify exact domain match in settings |
| Parameter removed on transition | Redirects clear query parameters | Configure parameter preservation in redirect rules |
| Different Client IDs on domains | Cookie not overwritten | Check allowLinker setting on receiving domain |
| Session resets | Parameter expired (>2 minutes) | Reduce number of redirects |
| Cookie-blocking extensions block cookies | User privacy settings | Consider server-side tracking |

## Special Use Cases

### Subdomains

Google Analytics 4 can track visitors across subdomains without additional configuration. However, there are nuances:

!!! warning "When Subdomain Setup is Needed"
    
    - Different cookie domain settings
    - Using different GTM containers
    - Custom JavaScript implementation
    - Need to filter specific subdomains

### Multiple Domains

When working with more than two domains, consider:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Main Site<br/>example.com] --> B[Blog<br/>blog.example.com]
    A --> C[Store<br/>shop.example.net]
    C --> D[Payments<br/>payment-gateway.com]
    C --> E[Support<br/>support.example.io]
    
    style A fill:#e8f4f8
    style C fill:#fff4e6
    style D fill:#ffe6e6
```

**Optimization Strategies:**

- Minimize cross-domain transitions
- Use single domain for critical processes
