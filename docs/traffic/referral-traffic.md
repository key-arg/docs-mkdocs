# Referral Traffic: Link Traffic and Partnership Sources Analysis

Referral traffic is **visitors who arrive at your website through links from other web resources**, excluding search engines and direct visits. When a visitor clicks a link from another website — such as a blog post, forum, or review site — this traffic is classified as referral. Understanding and properly working with referral traffic opens new opportunities for growth and partnership development.

## The Nature of Referral Traffic

Referral traffic forms naturally when other resources mention your site. Referral traffic includes traffic from partners, links, content partners, and traffic from direct media buying or news coverage. Unlike paid advertising, these links often remain active for years, continuing to bring visitors.

The main channels for referral traffic formation include:

**Content Mentions:**

- Blog and news publication articles
- Product and service reviews
- Expert materials with examples
- Guest posts

**Partner Placements:**

- Company catalogs and directories
- Professional associations
- Industry portals
- Business listings

**Communities and Forums:**

- Topical discussions
- User recommendations
- Q&A responses with links
- Use cases and examples

**Review Platforms:**

- Service comparison sites
- Review aggregators
- Rating platforms
- Professional reviews

## Analysis and Automation Tools

### Tracking Setup

To effectively monitor referral traffic, you need to properly configure analytics systems:

- Extending conversion windows to 90+ days
- Analyzing assisted conversions
- Accounting for offline influence of online interactions

### Privacy and Tracking

Modern privacy restrictions create new challenges:

- Transition to first-party data
- Using server-side tracking
- Developing direct partner integrations
- Focus on quality interaction metrics

## Partnership Ecosystem Development

### Source Diversification

Anything over 7% is considered excellent for referral traffic. For sustainable growth, it's important to:

- Maintain balance between different partner types
- Not depend on one large source (maximum 40% from one partner)
- Develop both strategic and tactical partnerships
- Constantly test new channels

### Scaling Successful Practices

After identifying effective partnerships, it's important to scale successful models:

!!! tip "Scaling Strategies"

    - Documenting successful cases to attract new partners
    - Creating partner programs with clear terms
    - Developing tools and resources for partners
    - Building a community around the partner program
